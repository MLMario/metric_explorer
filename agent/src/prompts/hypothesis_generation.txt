Generate hypotheses for why this metric changed.

## Context

**Target Metric**: {target_metric}
**Metric Definition**: {metric_definition}
**Source File**: {source_file}

**Baseline Period**: {baseline_start} to {baseline_end}
**Comparison Period**: {comparison_start} to {comparison_end}

**Business Context**:
{business_context}

**User Focus Areas** (if provided):
{investigation_prompt}

## Available Dimensions

Based on the data model, these dimensions are available for analysis:
{available_dimensions}

## Task

Generate 5-7 hypotheses that could explain why the metric changed. Each hypothesis should be:
- **Testable**: Can be validated or invalidated with the available data
- **Specific**: Focused on particular dimensions or segments
- **Causal**: Tells a story about WHY the change occurred

## Output Format

Return a JSON array:
```json
[
  {
    "id": "H1",
    "title": "iOS App Update Impact",
    "causal_story": "A recent iOS app update introduced bugs causing users to churn, leading to DAU decline on iOS devices.",
    "dimensions": ["platform", "app_version"],
    "expected_pattern": "iOS DAU should show significant decline while Android remains stable",
    "priority": 1,
    "status": "PENDING"
  }
]
```

## Priority Guidelines

- Priority 1-2: Most plausible based on context and common patterns
- Priority 3-4: Reasonable alternatives worth investigating
- Priority 5-7: Less likely but possible explanations

## Common Hypothesis Patterns

- **Segment shift**: One segment (geo, platform, user type) drove the change
- **Feature impact**: A product change affected user behavior
- **Seasonal effect**: Time-based patterns (day of week, holidays)
- **External event**: Market conditions, competitor actions
- **Data quality**: Tracking issues, definition changes
